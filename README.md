### ***OVERVIEW:***

A currency converter tool that runs on C++. A demo of me teaching myself C++. Currently supports conversions from GPB(pounds), EUR(euros), and INR(Indian rupees).

### ***INCLUDED FILES:***

 * currency_converter.cpp - The driver file that gathers user input, and calculates desired currency based on user input.
 * README - A brief overview of the program, how to run and compile it, related concepts, and testing information.
 * The other files in here are JSON files and things of that nature that allowed me to compile and run my C++ program on VS Code.

### ***COMPILING AND RUNNING:***

 I am going to describe how to compile and run the program on VSCode. 
 To do so, you will have to install two extensions and an integrated development environment on your machine. Don't worry it takes maybe 5 minutes!

 First off, the extension is needed regardless of whether you are on Mac, Windows, Linux, etc. To install the extension look up "Code Runner" 
 in the VSCode extensions tab. The other extension you need installed is the "C/C++ Extension Pack" by Microsoft.
 Once both are installed it is now time to install an integrated development environment on your system.

 To install the integrated development system on Mac, I would recommend installing Xcode. This will allow you to compile your code with clang.
 To do so, open a terminal and type the command: 
 <pre>
  xcode-select --install
 </pre>
 If your machine says you already have it, make sure by using the command:
 <pre>
  - clang --version
 </pre>

 To install the development/compiling system on Windows, I would recommend watching this 5-minute [video]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VE7p-he4fA))

 Once these dependencies are installed, watch [this]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-9sObAg6R0)) video on how to run and compile the program in the VSCode terminal.
