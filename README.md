### ***OVERVIEW:***

A currency converter tool that runs on C++. A demo of me teaching myself C++. Currently supports conversions from GPB(pounds), EUR(euros), and INR(Indian rupees).

### ***INCLUDED FILES:***

 * currency_converter.cpp - The driver file that gathers user input, and calculates desired currency based on user input.
 * README - A brief overview of the program, how to run and compile it, related concepts, and testing information.
 * The other files in here are JSON files and things of that nature that allowed me to compile and run my C++ program on VS Code.

### ***COMPILING AND RUNNING:***

 In a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing all source files, compile all
 java files with the command:

 The console output will give the results after the program finishes.
